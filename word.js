// Word.js: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting 
//to guess. That means the constructor should define:

// An array of new Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word
	//so function parses choosen word into letter objects.

	function parseWord(word) {
    return word.split("");             // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}

var wordLetters = parseWord()
	


// A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in Letter.js) that displays
// the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.
	//checks if letters match and returns letters or underscores accordingly.
	
// A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in Letter.js)
